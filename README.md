# Foobar

In this project, we have developed a Facebook-like application within a client-server environment.

For the client-side implementation, we utilized Android Studio along with Java language.

The client environment communicates with a Node.js server, which in turn interacts with another C++ server. This C++ server is responsible for validating the links embedded within the text of a post to determine if they are potentially malicious.<br>

The whole process of installing and running the project is in the wiki at https://github.com/AdvaOren/foobar.git. Enjoy!<br>
